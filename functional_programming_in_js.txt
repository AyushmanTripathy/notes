Functional Programming 
----------------------
is a programming paradigm, mindset, coding style.
safe and better to debug

Commandments
------------
1. do every thing with functions
2. functions should be pure (avoid side effects)
   side effect - anything other than returning an output from a input
               - using global variables
               - console loging
3. higher order functions
   functions as input and output of a function
4. donot iterate, use recursion
   map - do something to every item
   reduce - compines something from every item
   filter - make a list of everthing satifying a condition
5. immutable data
6. persistant data structures (immutable.js, mori)
