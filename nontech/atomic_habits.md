# Atomic Habits

from: Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Tiny changes

- tiny changes can have huge impact over time

## Changing your identity

- change your personal identity, itself
- instead of starting a reading habit, become a reader
- habits wont last if they clash with your personal identity

## Making it Obvious

### Habit Scoreboard

- just be consiuos of things you are doing
- when doing a bad habit, just remind yourself you are doing something bad.
- dont blame yourself, just be consious

### Implementation Intent

- decide what you want to do, where and at what time
- removes mental overhead

```
I will do (thing) duing (time) at (place)
```

### Habit Stacking

- add new habits, after established habits

```
after (old habit) i will do (new habit)
```

### Motivation < Enviroment

- cues trigger habits
- arrage cues in your enviroment
- one space one work

```
cues -> craving -> response -> reward
```

### Self Control

- best way is to avoid using your willpower
- making your enviroment disciplined is better
- habits never go away, but cues can be avoided

## Making it Attractive

- we don't want our bad habits
- we want to satisfy our primal insticts
- replace bad with good habits that satify primal instincts

### Supernormal Stiumuli

- birds perfer largers eggs with markings, 
- showing them eggs with exaggerated markings & size, and they go crazy
- similarly, fast food, porn, bollywood movie stars are supernormal stimuli

### Dopamine Level

- anticipation of reward, not its fullfilment, gets us to take action
- after habits are formed
    - rewards dont give dopamine spikes
    - thier absense drops dopamine
    - a delayed reward can give spike in dopamine

### Role of family & friends

- see `Polg√°r` experiment
- human minds wants to belong in a group
- what we call peer preasure
- we want to fit in, then want to stand out

## Law of least effort

- people are inherently lazy
- we choose the option that takes lest effort
- current habit triggers the next effort

### 2 Minute Rule

- gateway habit easier to getting things started
- small efforts even only for 2 minutes
