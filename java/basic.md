# Types

## Primitives

1. byte
1. short
1. int
1. long
1. float
1. double
1. char (2 bytes, for unicode)
1. boolean (size is not defined)

- floats have to be typecasted

```java
float x = (float) 1.0;
float x = 1.0f;
```

- all have wrapper types, Integer, Float, Boolean etc.
- all wrapper types are child of `Number` class, except Character.
