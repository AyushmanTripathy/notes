DIFFERENCE ARRAY
----------------

WHEN
  update all values in range [i, j]
HOW
  calculate i's value relative to i - 1

diffrence array is calculated
a[0] is not changed
a[i] = a[i] - a[i - 1]

when range [i, j] has to increased by dx
a[i] += dx
a[j + 1] -= dx

original array is calculated
a[0] is not changed
a[i] = a[i] + a[i - 1]
