LINKED LIST
-----------

WHEN
  when question comes
HOW
  each node has a val and a next pointer

O(n) time and O(1) time

SINGLY LINKED
-------------

when related to size, use two pointer
(use difference between pointer)

adding a dummy node to start
(return dummy->next)

TORTOISE AND HARE
-----------------

WHEN
  dectecting cycles
HOW
  one pointer is faster than other
  i moves at speed 1, j moves at 2
  if they meet -> cycle

Node * t = head, * h = head;
while (h != nullptr) {
    if (h->next == nullptr) return false;
    else h = h->next->next; 
    t = t->next;
    if (h == t) return true;
}
return false;
