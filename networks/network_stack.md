# Network Protocol Stack

there are layers,

1. Application (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
1. Transport (TCP, UDP, RTP)
1. Network (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS)
1. Data Link (Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, UMTS, LTE)
1. Physical

also some other protocols, don't fit into single layer.
like DNS, SNMP, ARP, DHCP

### Protocol

## OSI Model Layers

1. Application
1. Presentation
1. Session
1. Transport
1. Network
1. Data Link
