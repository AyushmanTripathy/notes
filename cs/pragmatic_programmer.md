from: [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://github.com/HugoMatilla/The-Pragmatic-Programmer)

random tips i liked from the summary of the book

## A Pragmatic Approach

- Donot Repeat Yourselves, make it easy to reuse
- Tracer bullets to find the target
- Estimation of time and effort before working

### Orthogonality

- change to one doesnot affect other  
- just as orthogonal vectors
- avoid global data and similar functions

## The Basic Tools

- Keep knowledge in plain text
- use power of shell commands
- Learning a text manipulation language
- Write code that writes code

### Debugging

- dont waste time on but that can't happen talk.  
- ways to fix
    - bug reproduction
    - tracing, what happens before or after
    - elimination of causes
    - rubber ducking, explain to someone else
    - visiualising the data
- `Select Isn't Broken`, i.e. its always your fault
- Solaris story read [here](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-first-rule-of-programming-its-always-your-fault/).
