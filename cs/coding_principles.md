# Coding Principles

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- reducing code duplication
- code should be modular, reusable and maintainable
- Do it once

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need it)

- only add features that are needed
- not to overcomplicate code
- Do the Needfull

## KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)

- make the code understandable and maintainable
- Do it Simply

## SOLID

1. Single Responsibility

- single class has a single responsibility
- reduces merge conflicts

2. Open Closed

- open to extension but closed to modification
- don't change existing classes, becauses you have tests

3. Liskov Substitution

- any superclass should be replaceable with their subclass
- subclass should be behave similar to their superclass

4. Interface Segregation

- An interface should not be bulky
- makes class have functions that are not implemented

5. Dendency Inversion

- high level component should not depend on low level component
- they should both depend on an abstraction
